# Huxli Project

## Architecture

### Backend
* Python? Ruby?
* DB: **Mongo?** MySQL?
  * Mongo: Horizontally scalable... more flexible
  * Speed -- mongo vs. mysql vs.
  * Well, if the frontend is going to be running JS, that's super compatible with MongoDB since mongo is JS under the hood (kinda)

### Frontend
* HTML/CSS (fuckin duh)
* React???
